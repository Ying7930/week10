#Debug log

###What I expected
- Control the zoom in/zoom out effect with an potentiometer

###The Behavior
- Having 3 pieces of led kits, cannot control them all at once.
- The wheel are spinning, cannot control the potentiometer (the potentiometer is moving, too).
 - if connect them all to one potentiomter, the wire mess up.

###The Hypothesis
- It's moving....
- Will it be better if the potentiometer is at the middle of the wheel, and it's bigger?
 - I don't think it will be working, because the potentiometer will still spining, it will be hard to control.
- Is it possible to make it wireless, or detached the potentiometer from the wheel?
 - methods to make the wire won't mix together while spinning.

###Test
- Cannot test it, yet.  Missing tools and ideas.
