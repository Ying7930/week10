#Debug log

##What I expected
- Control the zoom in/zoom out effect with an potentiometer
##The Behavior
- Having 3 pieces of led kits, cannot control them all at once.
- The wheel are spining, cannot control the potentiometer (the potentiometer is moving, too).
 - if connect them all to one potentiomter, the wire mess up.
##The Hypothesis
- It's moving....
- Will it be better if the potentiometer is at the middle of the wheel, and it's bigger?
##Test
- Cannot test it, yet.  Missing tools.
